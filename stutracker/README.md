## StuTracker

Welcome to StuTracker—a modern web application designed to revolutionize academic progress tracking and classroom management. Built with a passion for education and technology, StuTracker empowers students to monitor their learning journey and equips teachers with tools to manage courses effectively. This is a work in progress( initially as a project idea for a graduation project at ALX), with exciting features on the horizon! This is really ##doHardThings in action with ALX.

## Project Overview

StuTracker is a role-based platform tailored for students and teachers. It offers intuitive dashboards, course management, and progress tracking—all wrapped in a sleek, user-friendly interface. While it currently operates with mock data stored in localStorage, the foundation is set for a scalable backend integration in the future.

## Key Features (Implemented)

--Teacher Dashboard: Create and manage courses, enroll students, and track class progress with detailed visualizations.

-- Student Course Details: View enrolled courses, monitor progress with charts, and access course materials (currently mock content).

-- Welcome Page: A dynamic landing page with particle animations, tagline rotation, and a bold call-to-action.

-- About Page: A professional overview of the project’s mission, tech stack, and team (just me for now!).

-- Contact Page: An interactive form and contact info section with 3D card flips and glowing effects.

-- Modern UI: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, featuring animations (Framer Motion), particle effects (tsParticles), and a consistent theme.
Future Features (Work in Progress)

## I’m actively working on expanding StuTracker to make it a comprehensive educational tool. Here’s what’s coming:

-- Parental Dashboard: A dedicated space for parents to track their child’s progress, communicate with teachers, and stay engaged.
-- Principal/School Director Dashboard: Tools for school leaders to oversee performance metrics, manage staff, and analyze trends across classes.
Forum Pages: A community hub for students, teachers, and parents to discuss topics, share resources, and collaborate.
-- Backend Integration: Replacing mock data with a real database (e.g., Firebase, Node.js/Express) for persistent storage and user authentication.
-- Mobile App: A companion app to bring StuTracker to iOS and Android.
-- Advanced Analytics: Deeper insights with AI-driven predictions and personalized recommendations.
These features are in the planning or early development stages—stay tuned for updates!

## Usage

Teacher Login: Use teacher@example.com with password @Password#123 and student@example.com with password @Password#123 to access the Teacher Dashboard and Student Dashboard respectively or signup as teacher/student role.
Explore Pages: Navigate to /welcome, /about, and /contact to see the implemented UI.
Mock Data: Courses and student progress are pre-populated for demo purposes.

## Project Status

StuTracker is a passion project under active development by me, Abebe Duguma. While the core functionality for teachers and students is in place, there’s a lot more to come! I’m a solo developer balancing this with other commitments, so progress is steady but gradual. The Parental Dashboard, Principal/School Director features, and Forum pages are high on my list, along with a proper backend. I’m excited to keep building and welcome feedback or collaboration ideas!

Contributing
I’d love to hear your thoughts! If you’re interested in contributing—whether it’s code, design, or ideas—please:

Fork the repo.
Create a branch (git checkout -b feature/awesome-idea).
Commit your changes (git commit -m "Add something cool").
Push to your branch (git push origin feature/awesome-idea).
Open a pull request.
Since I’m still shaping the project, feel free to open an issue to discuss potential contributions or report bugs.

## Known Limitations

Mock Data Only: No real backend yet—data resets on page refresh.
Limited Roles: Only teacher and student views are implemented.
Mobile Optimization: Desktop-focused for now; mobile enhancements are planned.
Basic Security: No real authentication beyond mock logins.
These are all on my radar to address as the project grows.

## Acknowledgments

Inspired by my love for education and coding.
Thanks to the ALX community for "#doHardThings" with you and open-source community for amazing libraries and tools.
Shoutout to anyone who tests or provides feedback—you’re helping shape StuTracker!

## License

This project is unlicensed for now, as it’s a personal work in progress. I’ll add a proper license (likely MIT) once it’s more complete.

## A Note from Abebe(codingaday):

StuTracker is my dream to make education more accessible and organized. I’m pouring my heart into it, and while there’s plenty left to build—like the Parental Dashboard and Forum—I’m thrilled with how it’s coming together. Thanks for checking it out, and I hope you’ll follow along as it evolves!
